# Calculator
Yes! this is a online calculator
I wrote this app about 1 years ago while i just get started with C#.
Its features is very simple:
- Addition
- Substraction
- Multiplication
- Division 
Moreover, it can do combination of calculating at same time without pressing equal button every time. In another words, it's very much similar to the calculator on IOS.
